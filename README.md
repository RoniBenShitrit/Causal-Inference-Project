# Causal-Inference-Project
The goal of this project is to estimate the causal effect of adding a code sample to a question on StackOverflow on the chances of getting an answer to that question.
Our data consists of 50,000 questions of StackOverflow, extracted from "Data Explorer" platform with the query **Data extraction query**
In our project, we pre-processed the data and estimated propensity scores and ATEs with several different models.
